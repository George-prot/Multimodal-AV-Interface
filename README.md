Developed an Augmented Reality (AR) windshield display (WSD) within a mobile office setting in an autonomously driven vehicle simulated in a Virtual Environment. The system combines gaze-based interaction techniques, such as eye blink and dwell-time, as well as voice commands to offer a hands-free interface for controlling vehicle functions, such as air conditioning and radio, as well as office tasks like phone calls and messaging. The system uses the HTC Vive Pro Eye with SRanipal SDK for real-time eye tracking, together with TobiiXR SDK for advanced gaze-based interactions. Built using the Unity game engine, the simulator enables the users to experience an autonomous vehicle while navigating an urban environment. Unity’s Speech and Dictation Recognizers also help to implement voice command interactions and speech to text writing.

This project explores the development and implementation of a multimodal AR User Interface for autonomous driving cars, within a VR simulated environment.  The core of this project is a simulator built in Unity game engine, featuring a virtual reality environment where an autonomous driver navigates the roads of a city. [Bazilinsky's coupled simulator](https://github.com/bazilinskyy/coupled-sim) was adapted from a desktop application to a VR version, with modifications to suit the new platform.

The user interface, designed for AR, allows users to interact with the autonomous vehicle using eye tracking and voice commands, providing hands free and intuitive interactions.  More specifically, the UI can be used for simple car functions such as radio and A/C as well as for simple office work like sending and reading messages and voice calling. Additionally, the interface informs users of the autonomous driver’s actions through warning notifications in order to amplify user’s trust towards the autonomous vehicle.
