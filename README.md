Developed an Augmented Reality (AR) windshield display (WSD) within a mobile office setting in an autonomously driven vehicle simulated in a Virtual Environment. The system combines gaze-based interaction techniques, such as eye blink and dwell-time, as well as voice commands to offer a hands-free interface for controlling vehicle functions, such as air conditioning and radio, as well as office tasks like phone calls and messaging. The system uses the HTC Vive Pro Eye with SRanipal SDK for real-time eye tracking, together with TobiiXR SDK for advanced gaze-based interactions. Built using the Unity game engine, the simulator enables the users to experience an autonomous vehicle while navigating an urban environment. Unityâ€™s Speech and Dictation Recognizers also help to implement voice command interactions and speech to text writing.
